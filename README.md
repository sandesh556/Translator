# Translator

## To translate your lang
 1. Navigate to lang forlder you will find a lang.py file.
 2. In that file make sure you enter your required key values in a json supported format.
 3. Example: {
               "key" : "value",
             }
 4. And then after all your content is inserted into this run the main.py, and you will see your translation in each folder in php format and then use it in your laravel project.

Note: bsn -> is hr which is croatian and ko is just kr which is korean.
Also, this library doesn't translate english to british english that will have to be done manually
